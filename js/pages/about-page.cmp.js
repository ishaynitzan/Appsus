    The concept of reading is by no means static. Technologies have undoubtedly affected the ways that we consume and produce written content, the tools that we use, our reading style, and even how we organize our thoughts as we read. Digital technologies seem to have finally taken the book to its next stage. The vision of building a product from which different stakeholders can build book-related services and applications in a quicker and more efficient manner is not new, as academia and other publishing experts have already done some thinking about it. However, no commercial tool still exists that enables access to general book-related content. This article will introduce the concept of a “Book as a Service” platform, a software product that enables access to digital books and related functions such as text mining, reading analytics, and metadata so that other companies can create innovative services and products on top of it. The opportunities and challenges of this type of platform from technical, legal, and business standpoints will also be discussed, as well as its implications when redefining the possibilities of the written word.
